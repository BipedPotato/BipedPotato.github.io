        <p>I made this game for the GMTK Game Jam 2023 in under 48 hours with Rust and Bevy. Unlike my previious attempts this went quite well as I was now pretty comfortable with Rust and Bevy.

        <p>I made this game for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 in under 48 hours with Rust and Bevy.
          I struggled due to my limited 1 week understanding of Rust and Bevy and had to learn 
          an entirely new area of Bevy as I had only used 2d prior to this jam

        <p>I made this game for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam in 48 hours with my own game engine built in C++ and OpenGL.
          Ultimately I abandoned the engine as it was extremely hard to maintain and it was overall not very efficient or practical.
          This was one of the hardest game jams I ever participated in and was the first one I made a video for.
          The video was really badly edited and undeservingly got more than 7k views only because the idea was unique.

        <h2>BenBonk Game Jam #3</h2>
        <p>I made this game for the BenBonk Game Jam #3 in 72 hours using Unity. I was really satisfied with this game 
          as a second game jam game I got #5 out of 133 games in terms of theme. However I did pretty horribly in the music category and got bumped down to just above average overall.
